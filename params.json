{"name":"Nextjscompiler","tagline":"Alternative extjs app source code compiler","body":"Extjs Compiler\r\n==============\r\n\r\nThis is an experiment in building a \"compiled\" javascript source file for an\r\nextjs application. \r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n---\r\nThe official tool seems lacking in at least these areas:\r\n\r\n  - Exit status always returns 0 making it useless for deployment scripts\r\n  - It forces the use of a static html file as the input file. Front controller\r\nstyle web applications do not use a file like this so, the file must be created\r\nand maintained separately.\r\n  - Files are often not included in the build file.\r\n\r\nSo this tool aims to address these issues.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\n    java -jar dist/java-extjs-compiler.jar --app YourNamespace.Application \\\r\n    --src src/dir --output path/to/app-all.min.js\r\n\r\nOptional:\r\n\r\n--prepend Optional path to a javascript file to prepend to the the ouput file\r\nbefore the compiled output.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
